# Spam-Classification-using-NLP
"Spam Classification using NLP" builds SMS spam classifier using text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and a Naive Bayes model. It processes SMS data by cleaning, tokenizing, and stemming words, then trains the classifier to detect spam. Stages include data loading, preprocessing, training, evaluation to assess accuracy and model performance.

This project focuses on building a simple spam classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The classifier is trained to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) SMS messages. 

## Project Overview
Spam detection is an important application in NLP, helping to filter unwanted messages. This project utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification, a popular choice for text classification problems.
